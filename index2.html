<body>

<p>The user will be able to click on the get quote button.There will be some quotes that will populate on the page.The genre is listed as age. </p>
</p>The user will then read the quote and then guess what Author wrote the quote.After guessing, the user will then click on the button that say reveal answer to see if the answer they guess was correct. </p>
<p>This process will continue until the user have finished with those quotes that was created and when the user is ready for the next set of quotes. The user will then repeat to click on the get quotes button.</p>
<p>When the user wants to clear the get quotes page, all the user would do is click on the clear get quotes button and that would clear all the quotes. </p>
